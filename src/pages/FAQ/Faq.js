                <h2>What is index trading?</h2>
                <p>Index trading involves investing in a basket of assets – in this case, a portfolio of proven crypto trading strategies. This approach provides diversification, spreading your risk across multiple traders. It can also offer smoother returns compared to investing in a single strategy, which might be more volatile.</p>

                <h2>What is KYT - Know Your Trader's trader selection process?</h2>

Finally, we conduct personal interviews with potential traders to assess their expertise and investment approach. Only the top 0.3% make it through our selection process.</p>

                <h2>How are the risks controlled?</h2>
                <p>Before starting to invest, you independently set up risk management by determining the drawdown level and leverage. Make independent decisions about the level of risk comfort. When the set drawdown level is reached, trading on your account stops automatically, ensuring the safety of your funds. Additionally, KYT - Know Your Trader monitors the execution of each strategy's investment declaration and disables a strategy if it violates it. This approach provides comprehensive protection of funds both for trading strategies and for the investor's personal account.</p>

                <h2>How are my funds managed?</h2>
                <p>KYT - Know Your Trader operates on a non-custodial model. This means your funds always remain securely in your personal Binance account. We never take custody of your assets. We connect to your account via a secure API, allowing us to execute trades on your behalf based on your chosen index strategy.</p>
